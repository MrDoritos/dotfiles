# dotfiles

Use `./setup.sh` and `install` or `uninstall` to install or remove the installation

Some of my bash aliases and other tools

The only thing that isn't great is having to append to `~/.bashrc`

That being said, everything is sourced after all other things in `~/.bashrc` so that I'm able to override the default `HISTSIZE` and `HISTFILESIZE` by sourcing my own script

Configure the locations and user source file in `./setup.sh`
